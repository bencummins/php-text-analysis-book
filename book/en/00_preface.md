# Preface

Why am I writing this? Someone really needs to write a book on using PHP for text analysis. 
Sure all the other cool languages have libraries that are enterprise worthy and 
huge communities to support them. PHP is now over 20 years old and it is time we 
built our tools and our community.

For the last 15 years, I have worked with PHP. Whenever a task arose requiring text 
analysis or text processing, I would jump ship and use Perl, Java, or Python. 
Having knowledge of multiple languages is to be expected among developers, but 
it does not make the job any easier when you have to jump between software projects 
to find a which layer of the code lasagna has the software bug. 

PHP Text Analysis started out in 2009 - 2010 as a simple script to do frequency 
distributions of words in a given text. Initially, it was developed to analyze tweets.
It has developed over the years as my thirst for knowledge about Text Analysis, 
Natural Language Processing and Information Retrieval grew. It is an open source 
project, driven by a quest for knowledge and a desire to offer a toolkit for novices, 
academics, developers and software engineers. 

This book is modeled off of NLTK's book. NLTK is an exceptional piece of software and 
I appreciate all the effort the community has put into it. 


# What do you need ?
At a minimum you will need PHP installed. A lot of the examples in this book will 
be run from the command line. Everything should work with any version of PHP 7.0 
or greater.
